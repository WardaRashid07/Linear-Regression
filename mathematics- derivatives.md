# 1. Hypothesis Function (The Line Equation)

The best fit line in simple linear regression is modeled as:

**ŷ = mx + c**  
or  
**ŷ = β₀ + β₁x**

Where:  
- **ŷ**: Predicted output  
- **x**: Input feature  
- **β₀**: Intercept (equivalent to c)  
- **β₁**: Slope (equivalent to m)

---

In multiple linear regression, the hypothesis function becomes:

**ŷ = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ⋯ + βₙxₙ**
