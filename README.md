# 🔁 Step-by-Step: Internal Process of Finding the Best Fit Line (Linear Regression)

## 1. Hypothesis Function (The Line Equation)

The best fit line in **simple linear regression** is modeled as:

ŷ = mx + c       
     or      
     ŷ = β₀ + β₁x
--
Where:
- `ŷ`: Predicted output  
- `x`: Input feature  
- `β₀`: Intercept (c)  
- `β₁`: Slope (m)  

In **multiple linear regression**, it becomes:

ŷ = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ⋯ + βₙxₙ
## 2. Cost Function (Loss Function)

To measure how good the line is, we use **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:

J(β₀, β₁) = (1/n) * Σᵢ=1ⁿ (yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²
= (1/n) * Σᵢ=1ⁿ (yᵢ - (β₀ + β₁xᵢ))²

Our goal is to **minimize this error**.

## 3. Optimization Method

### 🅰️ Gradient Descent (Iterative Method)

1. **Initialize** β₀ and β₁ with random values.
2. **Compute gradients** (partial derivatives):

∂J/∂β₀ = -(2/n) * Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)
∂J/∂β₁ = -(2/n) * Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ) * xᵢ

3. **Update the weights**:

β₀ := β₀ - α * ∂J/∂β₀
β₁ := β₁ - α * ∂J/∂β₁

Where:
- `α` is the learning rate

4. **Repeat until convergence**

### 🅱️ Closed-form Solution (Analytical Method)

For **simple linear regression**:

β₁ = Σ(xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ) / Σ(xᵢ - x̄)²
β₀ = ȳ - β₁ * x̄

For **multiple linear regression (matrix form)**:

β = (XᵀX)⁻¹ Xᵀy

Where:
- `X`: Feature matrix (with a column of 1s for intercept)
- `y`: Target vector
- `β`: Coefficient vector

## 4. Output: The Best Fit Line

Once the optimal `β₀` and `β₁` are found:

ŷ = β₀ + β₁x

This line minimizes the squared error between predicted and actual values.
