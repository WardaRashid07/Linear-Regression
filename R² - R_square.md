we all know about correlation (regular "R")
- correlation values close to 1 or -1 are good and tell you two that two quantitative variables for example
weight and size are strongly related.   Correlation values close to zero are lame.


R-squared is very similar to its hipper cousin 'r',
but interpretation is easier.For example it's not 
obvious that when 'r' equals 0.7 that's twice as good a correlation as when 'r' equals 0.5.
However R-squared equals 0.7 is what it looks like it's 1.4 times as good as R-squared equals 0.5. 
The other thing that I like about R-squared is that it's easy and intuitive to calculate.
Given that we know an individual Mouse's size, is the mean, or average weight, the
best way to predict that individual Mouse's weight? 


RÂ² =  [ VAR(mean) - VAR( best_fit_line) ] / VAR( mean)
